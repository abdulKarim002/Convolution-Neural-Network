The convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning, feed-forward artificial neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. CNN use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing.


 

The CNN Model is using Tensor flow in the backend
the main library used is Keras and sub modules:
- Sequential
- Convolution2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dense
- Image Data Generator 

The image processing is done on two-part and the first part is subcategorize in four step
Part 1 - Building the CNN
1.  Convolution
2.  Max Pooling
3.  Flattering
4.  Full Connection

Part 2 - Fitting the CNN to the images
